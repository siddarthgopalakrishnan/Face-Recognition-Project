# Face-Recognition-Project
Simple face recognition script in python which identifies all the faces in an image.<br/>
This script detects and recognizes any face in an image.<br/>
Known faces will be tagged with the name and the unkown faces will be tagged as "Unknown".<br/>
* Note: This only runs in a 64-bit version of Python.<br/>
# How to Run
- Place an image inside of the root direcotry and rename it to "test.png". This will be the file in which we want to test our code on.
- Install all of the packages listed in 'requirements.txt' file with the following command on the terminal:<br/>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Place all of the faces that you wish to identify inside the folder "faces" and rename them as "face-name".jpg. This folder contains all of the known faces and will be how the program recognizes people.
- Run the "face_rec.py" script.
